## Learning goals & some tips

For transparency and clarity, these are the learning goals we will be testing:

- Writing Javascript (using variables, functions, return values, parameters)
- Working with arrays and objects
- Using array methods (.find, .filter, .map)
- Using npm packages (axios)
- Using axios to interact with your server from a different file/script

**TIP: Read the assignment carefully!** It is easy to accidentally deviate from an assignment, resulting in a frustrating experience. Taking the time to read the exercise can save you time and effort.

**TIP: Don't get stuck!** If you feel stuck, try taking a small walk, continuing on to a next step, or talking out loud about the problem you're facing (programmers call this "rubber-ducking"). Everybody can get stuck, but don't let it stop you. You are also allowed to ask for help if you're really stuck, just try to avoid it.

**TIP: Break problems up into smaller problems!** Before writing code make yourself a 'to-do list' or 'battleplan'. Use `console.log()` to help you with debugging!

### ‚ùó Axios

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: You will need the server you built in yesterday's exercise! If what you built is not fully functional, we will provide you with a fully functional version of it!

**Setup**:

1. Create a new file called `client.js`.
2. run `npm install axios`
3. Import (require) axios at the top.
4. Don't forget to start your server before trying each exercise!

**A** Create a function that makes an axios call to GET - `/` endpoint, and log ONLY the data.

**B** Create a function that makes an axios call to GET - `/message` endpoint, and log it.

**C** Make a function that takes NO params and makes and axios request to our server to get all characters and logs them.

**D** Make a function that takes 1 parameter (characterId) and makes and axios call to your GET - /characters/:id endpoint. We should log the character with that `id` that is returned from our route.

Your functions in this section should looks something like this:

```js
const axios = require('axios'); // ONLY ONCE

async function getCharacters() {
  const response = await axios.get('http://localhost:4000/characters');
  console.log(response.data);
}
```
